# SGR_Flows_AMP

This analysis was used to inform the San Gabriel River adaptive management plan
for flow management in the urbanized San Gabriel River, California, USA where 
modification of discharge of treated wastewater is desired to promote water reuse, 
without adversely affecting habitat and sensitive species reliant on the flows. 

The objectives of the AMP are to ensure continuation of the pre-Project conditions (overall quality and quantity) 
of the habitat influenced by treatment plant discharges.  

To accomplish this, it is important to understand:
•	Relationships between changes in WRP discharge and habitat quality
•	Sensitivity of the selected stressor s to changes in SGR river flow
•	Relative influence of changes in WRP discharge vs. other stressor variables on habitat
•	Intensity and duration of monitoring necessary to detect habitat changes associated with flow modifications

Note that there were many iterations during the model development, which is contained
in the following scripts. Final models for both stressor indicators as in 
Irving et al xxx is located in scripts 5, 5a, 6 & 6a
